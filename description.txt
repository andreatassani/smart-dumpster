This is an IoT-based public trash service manager; it is composed by five elements:

Android app: it permitts to a consumer to get the token to do a deposits of trash and he select the type of the trash (A,B,C: in real life it can be paper, plastic, can);
Arduino board: it receive information from the Android app about the material (in real life it is the front end of the trash service).
ESP SoC: it detect the weight on the end of deposits to send to the server (in real life it is the backend of the trash service).
Server: it response to the request from the other four element and it save each deposits on a mysql database.
Web dashboard: it permitts to an a remote operator to check te entire trash service, turn off and turn on the service in case of problem or maintenance, he receive each n seconds data about the weight and material and it can get from database the statistics about the last n days (in real life represets what the operator see in his monitor from the headquarters).

Communication:
ESP --- server: HTTP;
server --- dashboard: HTTP;
arduino --- app: bluetooth;
app --- servide: HTTP;

The server is made thanks to a ngrok tunnelling.

Tools:
ESP: c++, arduino-ide;
app: java, android studio;
arduino: c++, arduino-ide;
server: java, mysql, eclipse, xampp, ngrok;
dashboard: html, css, js;
